The storeroom service handles data requests which call for stock levels and recording new customers once they have been registered by the store.

The Home Office Data Service handles requests from any remote store by retrieving all the plans and phones BitMobile currently sells. It also handles sales updates between the store and the Home Office by registering sales on the Home Office Database.

The Provider Exchange service allows data transfer requests between BitMobiles stores and competitor providers in the event of customer transfers between networks by requesting their payout bill and phone number.

The BitMobile Client functions as an interface for the services that connect a BitMobile store with the BitMobile Home Office along with BitMobile's competitors.
